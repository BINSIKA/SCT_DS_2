 🚢 Titanic EDA: Python Survival Analysis

This project is a concise Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, performed entirely in Python using Pandas and Seaborn, confirming that survival was strongly influenced by passenger class, fare, and gender.

 🛠️Key Tools
Data Wrangling: Pandas and NumPy
Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib

 ✨ Core Insights
Socio-Economic: First-Class passengers and high-fare payers had the highest survival rates.
Protocol:Survival was overwhelmingly biased toward women ("women and children first").
Social:Traveling with a small family slightly increased survival probability compared to traveling alone.
